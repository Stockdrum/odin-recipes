            <li>1/4 cup mayo </li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup </li>
            <li>1/4 cup spicy brown mustard </li>
            <li>2 minced garlic cloves </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
            <li> 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li> salt and pepper, to taste </li>
            <li> pinch of sugar, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>

            <li> Mix all ingredients for the burger sauce, and set aside in the fridge.
                Mix all the Burger Juice ingredients together in a small bowl.
                In another medium-sized bowl, add the beef.
                Pour the Burger Juice into the beef, and gently break it up with a spoon or your hands and GENTLY mix
                thoroughly. Do not over-work your meat, be very very gentle with it. Once it’s thoroughly mixed, scoop
                into
                3-4oz sized balls. Cover the burger balls with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of a half
                hour.
                You want the meat to be super cold. You could also pop into your freezer for about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

                When ready to cook, heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until SUPER HOT. Drop a tiny sprinkle
                of
                water to test it, if it immediately sizzles and bounces around and disappears, it’s ready. No need to
                add
                oil, there’s plenty of fat in the burger. Remove your burgers from the fridge or freezer and sprinkle
                them
                with kosher salt and pepper. Place about 3 to 4 balls in the skillet, leaving room for them to be
                smashed
                down. After 30 seconds of searing, smash them all the way down until they can’t be smashed anymore, with
                a
                large heavy skillet. Leave them alone and let them cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, or when the edges
                start to
                turn brown. Flip them over and immediately place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. When the cheese
                melts, they’re ready, about 1 to 2 minutes longer.

                Build your burger with the toppings of your choice and enjoy
